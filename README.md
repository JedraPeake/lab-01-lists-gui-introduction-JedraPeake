Unit Tests allow the coder to make big changes to code quickly. You then can instantly find out  whether or not the code works through multiple scenarios through testing, it can also help you identify errors just as fast and hopefully get it up and runnig. In addition, unit tests help you really understand the design of the code you are working on. Instead of writing code to do just do something for one problem, you are starting by outlining all the conditions you are subjecting the code to (the contracts) and what outputs you'd expect from that.
